# ADL LRS

#### Installation tested on <b>Ubuntu 16.04</b> machine with Python 3.9. <b>Ubuntu 16.04+</b> is recommended. Updated to be compliant with the 1.0.3 xAPI spec.

This version is stable, but only intended to support a small amount of users as a proof of concept. While it uses programming best practices, it is not designed to take the place of an enterprise system.

## Installation (with Docker)

We recommend installing the ADL LRS via Docker. You can find detailed instructions on this process [here](https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS/blob/python3/docker/README.MD).
